# Prework - *My First IOS App*

Submitted by: **Devin Chen**

**My First IOS App** is an app that contains Devin's basic information and can randomly change the background color. 

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**My 5 favorite applications and their features**

1.Notion
- Flexible workspace for notes, tasks, and databases.
- Real-time collaboration with others.
- Clean interface that reduces distractions.

2.Slack 
- Organized conversations with channels.
- Quick file sharing and integration with tools like Google Drive.
- Searchable message history for past discussions.

3.Google Maps
- Real-time navigation and traffic updates.
- Easy integration with public transportation schedules.
- Ability to save favorite locations and create lists.

**My App Idea**
I want to build an app similar to Khan Academy but with a live lecturing option to increase interaction. It would provide free access to high-quality learning resources for students in underserved communities and connect them with volunteer tutors, teachers, and mentors. Students could get personalized help in subjects like math, science, and reading, while mentors track progress through simple dashboards. Key features would include live video tutoring sessions, practice problems with instant feedback, and mentorship matching based on student needs.


## Notes

At the beginning I'm not familiar with Xcode, so I'm having a little trouble finding things on the interface. But I'm much more confident navigating through Xcode now after I finish the project.
